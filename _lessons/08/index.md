## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> We now meet a new tone: the rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png). This tone will be the main focus for the next seven lessons. The rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png) is used to create content clauses, also known as *that*-clauses, because they often begin with the word "that" in English. In simple terms, a content clause is a sentence which can be used within another sentence. This is achieved by turning the sentence into a noun, and this is precisely what the rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png) does. **shîe súq** "that you are awake", is such a content clause. The rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png) is placed on the verb which begins the content clause: **shỉe** becomes **shîe**. Thus, we get from **shỉe súq** "you are awake" to **shîe súq** "that you are awake". We will see many more examples of this pattern, and it will soon become second nature.

2. <a name="fn-2" /> The word **beı** is placed before words to emphasize them. In speech, that emphasis can additionally be accompanied with a stress on **beı** itself, usually with a falling tone. It is **beı** that takes the stress because the word after **beı** must retain its original tone. We also see the next example of the rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png) here:  **pŷı jí** "that I'm annoyed", from **pỷı jí** "I'm annoyed". Thus, **Dủa jí pŷı jí** "I know that I'm annoyed".

3. <a name="fn-3" /> **sıa** "no", "zero", works like **sa** and **tu**. **sıa rảı** means "no thing(s)" or "nothing".

4. <a name="fn-4" /> For now, internalize this as a set phrase. 

5. <a name="fn-5" /> The literal meaning of **Chỏa bũ ba** is "May there not be talking".

6. <a name="fn-6" /> Here we see two more examples of the rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png): **sûaq súq sa rảı** "that you sing something", and **nûo jí** "that I sleep". In Toaq, instead of "I want you to sing", we say "I want that you sing": **shảo jí sûaq súq**.

7. <a name="fn-7" /> Here we have a fronted **hı** question. Recall that **hı** binding **rảı** here means that any subsequent occurence of **ráı** refers to the same thing(s). Therefore, a more literal translation of this sentence would be "what things are such that you want that I sing them".
