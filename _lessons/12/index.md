## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> This lesson introduces the word **lû**. **lû** could be described as the long form of the rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png). Instead of using the rising-falling tone directly on a verb, it is also possible to use **lû** to start a content clause. The meaning is identical to a bare rising-falling tone ![](../tones/t5.png): **Dủa jí shîe súq** "I know that you are awake" can also be expressed as the equivalent **Dủa jí lû shỉe súq**. The latter parallels **mâ** in structure. The main purpose of **lû** is to allow content clauses that begin with a noun in topic position, such as **lû jí bı jảı jí** "that, as for me, I'm happy". **lû** can only be replaced by a bare rising-falling tone when the content clause begins with a verb.

2. <a name="fn-2" /> We encounter two new long roots in this lesson: **elū** "to be an elephant", and **aıpū** "to be a ghost".

3. <a name="fn-3" /> This is another example of **mâ** "whether", creating an indirect *whether*-question. **hoq** is another pronoun, which means "that", referring to a case or situation that was just mentioned. **mâ jẻo hóq** "whether that is true".

4. <a name="fn-4" /> Another example of **lû**. The structure is the same as before: **lû**, then the topic noun followed by **bı**, followed by the verb and its nouns.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> This might be the longest and most complex sentence so far, but it's really just a combination of familiar patterns.  

6. <a name="fn-6" /> **pıkūaı** "to have to pee" is a compound with the components **pı** "to pee", and the familiar **kuaı** "to long for, to need".
